## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Resource Group consumes GTS type definitions owned by Types Registry. RG publishes
its base schema through managed GTS publication; each consuming gear publishes
its own derived types. Group and membership rows store the GTS identifiers,
without a local type catalog or surrogate type keys.

The former local type CRUD routes and SDK methods, type bootstrap interface and
configuration-driven type/group/membership seed services are removed. These
retired operations are not part of the current implementation contract. Their
replacement is owner publication followed by ordinary group and membership APIs.

### 1.2 Purpose

Keep schema admission, inheritance and type lifecycle in one registry while RG
retains responsibility for graph placement and tenant ownership. Type snapshot
reads use the caller context and occur before RG database transactions.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-manage-types`, `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-validate-type-code`, `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-reject-duplicate-type`, `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-seed-types`, `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-validate-type-update-hierarchy`, `cpt-cf-resource-group-fr-delete-type-only-if-empty`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-principle-dynamic-types`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-constraint-gts-identifiers`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cpt-cf-resource-group-actor-apps` | Publish consumer-owned declarations and use admitted types for group and membership operations |
| `cpt-cf-resource-group-actor-instance-administrator` | Publish deployment-owned declarations through the registry platform API and export local custom definitions before upgrading |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

Managed publication is orchestrated by the host runtime and Types Registry. RG
contributes its schema collector through `gts_publication` and performs no local
create/update/delete type operation. The registry's platform API is the deployment
interface for authored definitions. Registry admission, version preconditions and
receipts follow the Types Registry contract.

Group creation and membership addition remain RG actor flows in features 0003
and 0004. Their placement traits come from the admitted registry snapshot rather
than a local type CRUD service.

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### RG Type Identifier Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-algo-type-mgmt-validate-type-input`

**Input**: A group type identifier, normalized by trimming and lowercasing.

**Output**: Success or a validation error before lookup or persistence.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Reject an empty identifier - `inst-val-input-1`
2. [x] - `p1` - Check the identifier begins with the RG type family prefix - `inst-val-input-2`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Return a validation error if the prefix differs - `inst-val-input-2a`
3. [x] - `p1` - Reject identifiers longer than 1024 characters - `inst-val-input-3`

Full GTS shape validation belongs to the SDK value object. Definition admission,
parent/member references, inheritance and traits-schema validation belong to
Types Registry; RG does not duplicate them in this identifier check.

### Registry Snapshot Consumption

`RegistryTypeCatalog` implements `RgTypeCatalog` using `TypesRegistryApi` with the
caller's SecurityContext. Group payload reads request content, resolved schema
and effective traits; membership reads request effective traits in a batch.
`RgType` decodes placement rules and compiles the SDK payload validator from the
snapshot. No registry request occurs inside an RG write transaction.

A new group or membership requires active definitions. Existing group updates
that need type validation may use the exact retained definition of a deleted
type. Row-only reads, rename/metadata-clear operations with an unchanged parent,
and cleanup do not look up type definitions. Registry caller refusals and
availability failures retain their intended error classifications.

## 4. States (CDSL)

RG defines no separate lifecycle for type definitions. Types Registry owns active
and deleted states and retains definition content. Registry lifecycle changes do
not scan or rewrite existing RG group, membership or hierarchy rows.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Managed Owner Publication

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-dod-type-mgmt-managed-publication`

RG declares managed publication of its SDK collector. The host completes
publication before application initialization; consuming gears publish their own
RG-derived types. RG initialization constructs adapters and services without
performing registration or waiting on remote registry admission itself.

**Touches**: `resource-group/src/gear.rs`, `resource-group-sdk/src/gts.rs`.

### Caller-Scoped Registry Catalog

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-dod-type-mgmt-registry-catalog`

Type lookups forward the caller context, select the artifacts required by the
operation and distinguish absent/deleted definitions, access refusal,
unavailability and malformed registry responses. Placement and payload validation
use the materialized snapshot. Groups and memberships store GTS identifiers.

**Touches**: `resource-group/src/infra/types_registry.rs`, `resource-group/src/domain/type_catalog.rs`.

### Consumer-Owned Admission Coverage

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-dod-testing-managed-types`

Consumer-owned tests exercise real persisted Types Registry admission for the RG
base type and derived declarations. Tests cover inherited payload validation,
placement traits and invalid declarations. Adapter tests cover caller context,
requested projections, lifecycle policies and error classification.

**Touches**: `managed_types_admission_test.rs`, `registry_types_test.rs`, `infra/types_registry_tests.rs`.

### Error Conversion Chain Tests

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-resource-group-dod-testing-error-conversions`

Domain tests cover the conversion of enforcer and database failures into RG
errors. REST error mapping preserves caller-facing classifications and keeps
internal database details out of response bodies.

**Touches**: `domain_unit_test.rs`, `resource-group/src/domain/error.rs`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The RG base schema is contributed through managed GTS publication.
- [x] Consumers can publish derived RG types through Types Registry admission.
- [x] New group/membership writes use active registry definitions and effective placement traits.
- [x] Group payload validation uses the unmodified materialized schema through the registry SDK.
- [x] Type reads forward the caller context and precede database write transactions.
- [x] Cleanup and ordinary reads continue to use stored GTS identifiers without registry lookups.
- [x] Local type CRUD and bootstrap interfaces are absent from SDK, REST routes and OpenAPI.
- [x] Database migration preserves identifiers, groups, memberships and hierarchy while removing the local catalog.
- [x] Repeating an identical E2E declaration uses the registry's current version and leaves its resource version unchanged.

## 7. Verification

- `managed_types_admission_test.rs`: real persisted admission of consumer-owned schemas and traits.
- `registry_types_test.rs`: registry definition policies exercised by group and membership services.
- `infra/types_registry_tests.rs`: context/projection forwarding and error classification.
- SQLite/PostgreSQL type-identifier migration tests: preserved rows, indexes, constraints and rollback on refusal.
- `testing/e2e/suites/resource_group`: publication followed by group/membership HTTP calls, including repeat publication without a new revision.
